THE REPOSITORY

Hello, 
Now this is a story all about how 
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the coolest girl in a town 
called Garland
In Dallas born and raised 
on the playground was where I spent most of my 
days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool....
Okay I think you get the point...
this is the fresh prince theme song....
